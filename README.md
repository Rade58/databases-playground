KEY-VALUE STORES SU ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BEASTS; **ONI SU USALLY COMPANIONS TO OTHER DATBASES**

>> I like to think of a key-value store as a giant JavaScript object. You can `store['my-key']` = 5 and then later you can come back later and ask for `store['key']` and get 5 back. Honestly that's 90% of the use right there. You store a value under a key and then later you can ask for that key back. There are a few other operations you can too and we'll get there, but that's the general idea.
