BEFORE STARTING INSTALL DOCKER

[INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION](https://github.com/Rade58/exploring_docker/tree/0_2_INSTALLING_ON_UBUNTU)

SINCE I ALREADY INSTALLED IT; AND I TEND TO KEEP DOCKER DISABLED, SINCE I DON'T USE IT EVERY DAY; I AM GOING TO [START DOCKER](https://github.com/Rade58/microticket/tree/0_6_7_INSTALLING_GCloud_CONTEXT#medjutim-moram-napraviti-odluku-o-tome-da-li-zeli-mda-koristim-docker-na-mom-racunaru-ili-ne), RIGHT NOW, FOR PURPOSES OF THIS WORKSHOP

- `systemctl status docker.socket`

- `systemctl status docker.service`

- `sudo systemctl start docker.socket`

- `sudo systemctl start docker.service`

**NOT GOING TO USE `enable` BECAUSE I DON'T WANT DOCKER TO BE STARTED ON BOOT, NEXT TIME I TURN MY COMPUTER ON**
